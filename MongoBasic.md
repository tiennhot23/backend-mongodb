## How does MongoDB store data

MongoDB data is displayed in JSON and stored in BSON (Binary JSON)

![JSON and BSON.](./public/images/jsonandbson.PNG)

JSON objects are containers, wherein a string key is mapped to a value (number, string, boolean, array, null, object)

However, there are 2 issues for usage in a database:

- JSON lacks support for Date and Binary data
- JSON objects and properties dont have fixed length

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary representation to store data in JSON format, optimized for speed, space, and efficiency.

BSONâ€™s binary structure encodes type and length information, which allows it to be traversed much more quickly compared to JSON

BSON adds some non-JSON-native data types, like dates and binary data

BSON supports a variety of numeric types that are not native to JSON (Integer, Float, Long, Decimal128...)

## Documents database

A __document__ is a record in a document database, it store data in field-value pairs

A __collection__ is a group of documents.

Document databases have the following key features:

- `Document model`: Data is stored in documents (unlike other databases that store data in structures like tables or graphs). Documents map to objects in most popular programming languages
- `Flexible schema`: Document databases have a flexible schema, meaning that not all documents in a collection need to have the same fields.
- `Horizontal scaling`: Document databases are distributed, which allows for horizontal scaling and data distribution.

### What makes document databases different from relational databases?

- `Data model`: Data stored in a single document and map to the objects in code, there is no need to decompose data across tables, run expensive joins, or integrate a separate Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer
- `JSON doc`: JSON documents are lightweight and human-readable
- `Flexible schema`: Fields can vary from document to document, the structure can be modified at any time. Structure can optionally enforced with rules using schema validation

## CRUD

- __Querying on array elements__

__NOTE__: value is not enclosed in square brackets, mongodb will return all document within the `products` array that contain value or the key `products` has that value

=> Use the `$elemMatch` operator to find all documents that contain the specified subdocument

```js
db.collections.find({products: "abc"})
/* => [
  {
    _id: ...
    products: "abc"
  },
  {
    _id: ...
    products: ["abc", "xuz"]
  }
]
*/
db.collections.find({products: $elemMatch: {$eq: "abc"}})
/* => [
  {
    _id: ...
    products: ["abc", "xuz"]
  }
]
*/
```

- __Logical operators__

__NOTE__: coma `,` act like `$and` operators. But, if u want too use multi `$or` operators u must use `$and`.

```js
db.users.find({
  $and: [
    {$or: [{province: 77}, {country: "VN"}]},
    {$or: [{age: 23}, {career: "president"}]},
  ]
}) // => (province: 77 || country: "VN") && (age: 23 || career: "president")
db.users.find({
  $or: [{province: 77}, {country: "VN"}],
  $or: [{age: 23}, {career: "president"}],
}) // => age: 23 || career: "president"
```

This happen because in same JSON object, 2 field with the same key will be override, so in the example above, object with same key '$or' will be override with the 2nd $or operator

- __Expressive Query__

  $expr allows to use aggregation expressions, variables and conditional statements within query

 `$` sympol have 2 usage:

- Denotes the use of an operator (like $expr, $regexMatch, ...)
- Address the field value (such as value of field 'email')

```js
await EmailModel.find({ $expr: { $regexMatch: {
      input: '$email',
      regex: /@student[.\w]+$/,
    } } })
await UserModel.find({ $expr: { $eq: [ '$firstName', '$lastName' ] } })
```

- __Update document__

`updateOne(<filter>, <update>, <options>)`: didnt return updated document by default

Option `upsert` insert a new document with provided information if matching documents dont exist

```js
db.collections.updateOne({_id: ...}, {$set: {name: 'tien'}})
db.collections.updateOne({_id: ...}, {$push: {emails: 'tiennhot23@gmail.com'}})
db.collections.updateOne({name: 'tien'}, {$set: {age: 11}}, {upsert: true})
```

`findAndModify()` return updated document.

> Why dont use updateOne() and findOne()?
> Because it make 2 query to the server. Additionally, another user could modifiy the document before we exc findOne() => return a different version of docs

```js
db.collections.findAndModify({
  query: {_id: ....},
  update: {$inc: {age: -1}},
  new: true // make sure new version of updated doc is returned
})
```

`updateMany()` will not rollback the updated if there was any failed update doc, so some of them was updated, some are not

## Aggregation

Aggregation framework is an advanced query used to process on multiple documents through multiple `aggregation pipeline statges`. In each stage, it use an `aggregation pipeline operator` to tranform the input got from previous stage and return the ouput for the next stage.

### Aggregation pipeline operator

- $sum
- $avg
- $min
- $max
- $limit
- $push
- $addToSet
- $first
- $last

### Aggregation pipeline stages

- $project
- $match
- $group
- $sort
- $count
- $limit
- $set
- $out
